# He# Healing for Home 🌹
**Bridging the Gap Between Care and Crisis in Kosovë**

Healing for Home is a grassroots initiative dedicated to sending urgently needed medical supplies to clinics and hospitals in underfunded communities across Kosovë.

## 🏥 The Problem
In many parts of Kosovë, patients and healthcare workers face a harsh reality:
* Hospitals often run out of basic necessities like hand soap and toilet paper.
* People have to drive over an hour just to get treated because local facilities lack supplies.
* Healthcare workers are forced to work without the essential tools they need to save lives.

## ✨ Our Mission
We aim to bring "healing home" by:
1. **Collecting & Purchasing:** Gathering essential medical supplies.
2. **Direct Collaboration:** Working directly with local hospitals and clinics.
3. **Logistics:** Organizing and shipping materials to Kosovë.
4. **Ensuring Impact:** Making sure every supply gets into the right hands.

## 👩‍⚕️ Honoring Our Heritage
Our project is inspired by the legacy of Albanian women who dedicated their lives to care and resistance:
* **Queen Geraldine:** A trained nurse and Red Cross volunteer.
* **Sofia Noti:** A young martyr who provided medical care during WWII.
* **Hyrije Hana:** One of the first trained midwives who used her voice to uplift rural communities.

## ❤️ How You Can Help
* **Donate:** Any amount makes a significant impact.
* **Sponsor:** You can sponsor a kit, a box, or even a facility.
* **Share:** Help us spread our mission to the world.
